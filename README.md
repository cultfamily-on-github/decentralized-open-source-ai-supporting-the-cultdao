# Cultmagazine For Telegram
This repository is for the [CULT Mag News Bot](https://t.me/cultmagazine_bot).

If you would like to improve its knowledge and with that its skills, you might want to update its [training data](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/cultmagazine-for-telegram/blob/main/node-nlp-server/training-data.ts).

## Features 
1. Answer FAQs around the CULT according to the [training data](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/cultmagazine-for-telegram/blob/main/node-nlp-server/training-data.ts)   
2. Send daily reminder about the [CULT Game of the Day](https://cultplayground.org)   
3. Send custom messages to inform subscribers around important news via the bot ui for manual updates  

## Ideas
Feel free to share feature ideas via [this form](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/cultmagazine-for-telegram/issues/new).  

## Programming
Specific open source components we use for this are:   
1. [telegram_chatbot](https://deno.land/x/telegram_chatbot)     
2. [telegram_bot_ui](https://deno.land/x/telegram_bot_ui)  
3. [node-nlp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-nlp)  
4. [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) (TypeScript is Javascript that scales)

### Start it Locally
#### The telegram bot itself

In the main project folder execute the following command to start the CULT NLP Server serving via port 8081    
```sh
ts-node src/node-nlp-server.ts 8081
